### Examples

We explore examples from Nie & Wager's "Quasi-Oracle Estimation of
Heterogeneous Treatment Effects" from <i>Biometrika</i> 108(2) pp. 299â€“319
(2021), along with some custom examples we cooked up ourselves.

_To fully reproduce this experiment, clear the contents of [tmp/](./tmp/)
before running `nie_wager.py`_ Expect some variability in the results due to
random seeding and parallelism.
